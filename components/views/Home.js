        Launched in February 2023, Bitcorns is an OG Bitcoin Ordinals collection
        inscribed from 39k-47k. The collection was built on originality, memes,
        Bitcoin culture, and a strong community. As our earliest supporters,
        Bitcorns will always have access to the highest level of benefits to
        include airdrops, allowlists, giveaways, contests, and alpha.
